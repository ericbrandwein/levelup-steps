        li #[b Commander's Strike]. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
        li #[b Disarming Attack]. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
        li #[b Distracting Strike]. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.
        li #[b Evasive Footwork]. When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
        li #[b Feinting Attack]. You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
        li #[b Goading Attack]. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
        li #[b Lunging Attack]. When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
        li #[b Maneuvering Attack]. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position.

That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.
        li #[b Menacing Attack]. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach.

        li #[b Trip Attack]. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down.
