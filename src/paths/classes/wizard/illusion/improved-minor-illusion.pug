    | When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn
    | the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this
    | cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your
    | choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number
    | of cantrips known.
    | When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a
    | sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.
