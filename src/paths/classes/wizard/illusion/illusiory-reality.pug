block description
    | You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions
    | to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level
    | or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of
    | the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a
    | bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1
    | minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm
    | and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.
    | The object canâ€™t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.
