block description
    | You can create pockets of
    | relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells.
    | When you cast an evocation spell that affects other
    | creatures that you can see, you can choose a number
    | of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen
    | creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws
    | against the spell, and they take no damage if they would
    | normally take half damage on a successful save.
