block description
    | You add the polymorph spell to your
    | spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast
    | polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you
    | do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a
    | beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
    | Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can't do so
    | again until you finish a short or long rest, though you
    | can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
