h2 Spell Mastery
p
    | You have achieved such mastery over
    | certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a
    | 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that
    | are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their
    | lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
    | have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a
    | higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
    | By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
    | or both of the spells you chose for different spells of
    | the same levels.
