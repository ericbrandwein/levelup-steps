    | You can nimbly dodge out of the
    | way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery
    | breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
    | to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
    | throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
    | damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
    | half damage if you fail.
